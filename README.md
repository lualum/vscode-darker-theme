# Darker

**Darker** is a minimalist theme for Visual Studio Code designed for those who love the default "Dark Modern" aesthetic but find the background just a bit too bright for late-night coding sessions.

It maintains the exact syntax highlighting and UI colors of the default VS Code experience but lowering the brightness of the workspace background and side panels.
